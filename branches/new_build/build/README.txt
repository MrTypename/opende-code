SVN USERS: Before using these project files you must copy
config-default.h to ode/include/ode/config.h. 

This is my first take on a replacement set of Visual Studio project
files. They work fairly well, but have not been thorougly tested 
yet. Once I'm convinced the system is reasonably bulletproof I will 
write up additional documentation, including how to generate custom 
project files, and merge everything into the project trunk.
